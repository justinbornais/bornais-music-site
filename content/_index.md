My name is Justin Bornais, and one of my greatest passions is music! Some of the instruments I play are piano, trumpet, guitar, euphonium and saxophone, but my main focus is piano. I have been playing musical instruments since 2010.

I am a piano teacher, and have been for {{< teacher >}} years now. I currently have 12 students, and I have taught students aged 4 years old to senior age. My goal is to increase the number of students I have and teach other instruments like guitar, trumpet, and baritone horn.

Along with teaching, I also have a history of performing. In 2019 to early 2020, I would perform weekly at Fleur de Lisâ€”a small restaurant upstairs of Artisan Grill in Amherstburg. You may have also found me playing at St. John the Baptist Parish in Amherstburg, as well as Our Lady of the Assumption Catholic Church in Windsor throughout the 2010s. I also performed at my brother's wedding in 2021. I plan to continue performing at restaurants, as well as weddings and funerals in the future.

One of my goals is to continue composing. I have already created some pieces, one of which was performed by my high school concert band. Another goal of mine is to broaden my experience on the tech side of music, including recording and producing.
